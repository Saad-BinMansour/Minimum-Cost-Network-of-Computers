# Minimum-Cost-Network-of-Computers
## Introduction
This is an undergraduate Graph Theory project in Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University that deals with the Greedy Algorithm approaches.
## Description 
The goal of the project is to create a Minimum Cost Network of Computers (MCNC) for Al-Hilal Saudi company. Given a connection cost of every pair of computers that can be connected (there may be pairs of computers between which no direct connection can be built), Al-Hilal company aims to connect every computer with another either with a direct connection or via a sequence of  connections with a minimum total cost. The computer network must satisfy the following hard constraint:  Al-Hillal possesses two supercomputers that must be directly connected due to the high frequency and quantity of messages exchanged between them.
